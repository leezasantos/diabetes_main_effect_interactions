# by Beata Strack,1 Jonathan P. DeShazo,2 Chris Gennings,3 Juan L. Olmo,4 Sebastian Ventura,4 Krzysztof J. Cios,1,5 and John N. Clore6.

# This dataset include 101766 observations and 51 variables however, to complete our task, we will only be utilizing 5 variables consisting of 3 categorical(DV) and 2 continuous (IV).
# We have 5 tasks: 
# 1. Recode ‘category’ into High, Medium, and Low levels.
# 2. Recode ‘age’ age into Child, Adult, and Elderly levels. 
# 3. Determine if there is a main effect of RACE (utilizing levels of white or black only) or AGE (utilizing levels of child or adult only) on medication account and provide p-# value for Race and Age.
# 4. Determine if there is an interaction effect of CATEGORY (utilizing levels of low, medium, and high levels) or RACE (utilizing all five levels with the original dataset) with # medication count and provide p-value for Category, Race, and interaction. 
# 5. Provide the appropriate visualization that displays question 4 => category (with three levels), and race (with five levels) with medication count as the y-axis.
